Every program has a memory layout that comprises of:

- Text Segment
- Data Segment
- BSS Segment
- Heap
- Stack



Think of it like different parts of your brain, each with a specific function.

The Text Segment stores executable instructions in binary form.

The Data Segment stores initialized global and static variables.

The BSS Segment stores uninitialized global and static variables.

The Heap is the dynamic memory allocation region, useful for allocating memory at runtime.

The Stack is used for storing function calls, local variables, and function arguments.
